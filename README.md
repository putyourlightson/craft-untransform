# Untransform Plugin for Craft CMS 3

The Untransform plugin replaces image transform URLs with a placeholder image or with a base URL prefix for [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com/).

This can be especially helpful when working in a development environment in which the image assets do not exist. Rather than getting the broken image icon and pages taking forever to load due to invalid image transforms, display a placeholder image or the correct image transform from the live site.
